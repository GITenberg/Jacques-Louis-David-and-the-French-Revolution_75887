<p class="idc"><img src="images/i_fig03a.jpg" width="389" height="392" alt="I">
<span class="firstword">Is</span> it possible that a period like the French Revolution
and the era of Napoleon’s tyrannous rule should witness
the development of a great art? It would seem that
in the domain of art fresh creative impulses are born
more often in times of unrest and disturbance than in
periods of political security. Those epochs in the history
of art which we regard today as “golden ages”—the age of Pericles;
the Renaissance at about 1500; the Holland of the day of Frans Hals
and Rembrandt—were by no means peaceful years, but periods of
national strife and revolutionary ideas. No happy alliance is possible
between political discipline and art which springs from the free, untrammeled
impulse of the individual. We need only walk through those galleries
at Fontainebleau arranged by Napoleon during the days of his
Empire to recognize the deadening influence exerted by an established
autocracy, and feel blow coldly over us the chilly breath of an academic
and court-inspired art.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the period of the French Revolution, and the days
of Napoleon’s struggle to power, which coincided with the period of
David’s finest achievement, witnessed so powerful an onrush of new
ideas that their influence persists till the present day. Modern art had
its inception in this period, and today, after a lapse of over a hundred
years, is again tending in the direction first indicated by David. It is
herein that the significance of his contribution lies. Helped by the influences
of the revolution, he destroyed the artificial, hyper-refined art
ideals of the eighteenth century, and substituted for them a sterner, simpler,
more healthy and democratic art. That is not to affirm that his art
was greater than the one it superseded. David was not a genius of the
highest order as was Watteau, but to those of us sensitive to the forces
underlying our own times, it says—or should say—more than pre-revolutionary
art.</p>

<p>We need only to compare a portrait of David’s style like the one of
Madame de Servan (<a href="#i_fig1">Fig. 1</a>) with portraits of his predecessors (<a href="#i_fig2">Figs. 2</a>
and <a href="#i_fig3">3</a>) in order to recognize the difference between the Rococo period
and the new era, introduced by David. This portrait of Madame de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Servan, painted about 1800,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> impresses one as a composition of statuesque
simplicity expressing the salient spirit of a period which was seeking
fundamentally new doctrines by which to govern life. The portrait
by Rigaud, the famous court painter of the reign of Louis XIV, painted
in the beginning of the century, and of Boucher’s portrait of Madame de
Pompadour, painted in 1758, do not differ too much from another in
style. In these portraits of the Rococo period the surface is filled with a
restless play of short-curving lines; light and shadow are alternated
perpetually at close intervals; the colors form a pleasing pattern of
small variegated patches, and the costume and accessories almost
eclipse the real motif—that of portraiture. In David’s canvas the figure
emerges clearly from a wide and empty space, and a clear, flowing
line with definite horizontals and verticals has replaced the tortuous
curves. It seems an extraordinary piece of daring for the artist to have
composed in these broad planes with a completely empty background,
when we consider the century-old tradition embodied in the older paintings.
It was the French Revolution, with its rejection of old formulas
which inspired this daring.</p>

<p>But just as the revolution, from prelude to aftermath, covered a span
of some twenty years, so the artist required a similar period of time to
gradually attain the classic style which we see here stamped with the authority
of his fifty years.</p>

<p>Jacques Louis David was born in 1748 in the middle of the Louis XV
period, and the school which fathered him was that of Boucher, the frank
exponent of the playful and elegant school of painting fostered by the
artificial social life of Paris. David’s earliest known composition, “Minerva’s
Conquest of Mars,” painted in 1771 in the artist’s twenty-third
year, and now in the Louvre (<a href="#i_fig4">Fig. 4</a>), shows Boucher’s influence clearly.
Here we still have the unquiet baroque line of pre-revolutionary painting—the
picture is full of detail, the draperies worn by the figures flutter
in the breeze like those of Boucher and the cherubs beloved of this
master float in the clouds. The subject, too, is of the mythologic-allegorical
character affected by the painters of the court and the aristocracy.
The Goddess of Wisdom conquers the God of War! What irony
when we remember that twenty years later during the revolution the
painter of this picture was among those who helped let loose on France
a war of twenty years’ duration.</p>

<p>If we look more closely we can discern an alien spirit behind the apparently
suave portrayal. Despite his subject the young artist’s combative
vein emerges. True, Mars is overthrown, but with what ill grace he
accepts his fate. It might be Danton himself, the great revolutionary,
overthrown by his enemies. A face expressing such fury of despair, so
spasmodically clenched a hand was never portrayed by any of the playful
Rococo painters, and can we not discern something of the energetic
Napoleonic spirit in Minerva’s conquering pose?</p>

<p>David must have been of a naturally passionate and excitable temperament—possibly
inherited from his father who was killed in a duel
when the boy was eleven years old. As a young artist he applied for the
Prix de Rome, and when he did not at once receive it from the Academy,
was about to take his life in despair and was only persuaded by a friend
to abandon the idea of starving himself to death after three days of fasting
with that purpose in view. Later on, in extenuation of this episode,
he said: “This postponement of my journey to Italy was prejudicial to
my development, as I was four years too late in abandoning the bad
style of the French painters.” Like all reformers he believed that everything
produced by the generation preceding him was bad, although today
all that we can say is that it was different!</p>

<p>When, in 1775, he did actually set out for Rome, and his friends at
parting advised him to beware the influence of the antique, he replied
proudly, “Antique art cannot seduce me—it lacks fire and passion.”
Before long, however, he was in thrall to the classic art of Italy, and
within a few years his art had undergone a complete transformation,
not only in form but in subject. One of the first pictures that he sent
from Italy in 1781 to be exhibited in Paris was “The Blind Belisarius,”
now in the Museum at Lille (a later version, painted in 1784, in the
Louvre) (<a href="#i_fig5">Fig. 5</a>). Belisarius, once an all-powerful general of the Roman
Emperor Justinian, crouches, old, blind and poor by the side of the
road. The saviour of Rome and conqueror of Carthage has fallen into
disgrace with a master jealous of his fame, and is reduced to beggary.
A rich Roman lady, with tears in her eyes, is placing alms in the old
man’s helmet held out by a youth, while a passing soldier recognizes his
old commander with surprise and pain. Our artist has turned his back
on the cheerful Olympian themes of the allegoric-mythological school,
and with this tragic subject descends to that world of sorrow and misery
in which, but a few years later, he was to see his own nation engulfed. He
is still preoccupied, however, with classic themes seen through the eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
of that antiquity in which he had submerged himself. He has not yet
completely achieved his individual style, and Boucher’s influence is superseded
by that of another French painter who represented the classic
style one hundred years earlier—Poussin.</p>

<p>This influence lasted throughout his Italian period. Even as late as
1788 we are constantly reminded in his landscape studies of Nicolas
Poussin and Claude Lorrain, as may be exemplified by the two pages
from an hitherto unpublished Italian sketchbook dated 1788, reproducing
views from the surroundings of Rome (<a href="#i_fig7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#i_fig8">8</a>).<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Just as the poets and orators of the revolution harked back to the
classic trend of the seventeenth century—as Voltaire and even Robespierre
evoked Racine and Corneille—David, too, now followed a trend
of French art which has persisted from medieval times to the present
day, that line of classic, simple, antiquely conceived, clearly constructed
creations from which the highly developed church sculptures of
the middle ages, the Renaissance paintings of the period of Francis I,
and the art of Claude Lorrain and Poussin derive. Simplicity and
straight lines replaced the restless, complicated curve in the composition
of the Belisarius. It is not alone in the architecture, strongly influenced
by the antique, that the horizontal and vertical line multiplied itself, the
painter, too, sought to lend strength and rhythm to his composition by
a parallelism in the gestures of his figures. The arms of Belisarius and
the boy follow the same line, as do their feet, and the soldier’s hands repeat
the parallel gesture.</p>

<p>David achieved this linear coördination between figures and architecture
with even greater success in his next important work, “The Oath of
the Horatii,” painted in 1783 and now in the Louvre (<a href="#i_fig6">Fig. 6</a>). The figures,
divided into three groups, are posed in masterly fashion against the
three arches of the architectural background—three men on the left,
three female figures on the right, and the old man, holding out the three
swords in the centre. The movement swings from group to group with
the same rhythm that governs the curves of the arches, and is strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
emphasized by the parallel lines of limbs and draperies. We are told
that the outstretched foot of the foremost youth was drawn and redrawn
by David many times. It is now in exactly the right stance to determine
the general linear movement and is at the same time a masterpiece of
naturalistic drawing. The pose of this youth’s spear has been criticised
as practically impossible, but it requires precisely this continuous line to
strengthen the rhythm of the outstretched legs.</p>

<p>The motif is again drawn from Roman history, this time via a drama
by Corneille with which David was familiar. The three sons of the old
Horace, who occupies the centre of the canvas, were chosen by the
Romans to meet the Albans in single combat, the latter being also represented
by three brothers, the Curiatii. It had been agreed that this
combat should decide which race would have dominion over the other.
The victory fell to the Horatii, the representatives of Rome. Two of the
brothers fell in combat with the Curiatii, but the third triumphed
through a ruse—turning apparently in flight and killing his three opponents
one after another as they pursued him.</p>

<p>The trumpet call to freedom implicit in this composition must have
rung in the ears of the youthful French patriots who crowded to see it,
for it appeared at a moment when the soul of young France had been
stirred by the American war of independence. It was painted in the year
1783 when Benjamin Franklin signed in Paris that treaty with England
in which, for the first time, the independence of the American Union was
recognized. Beyond the Atlantic there had come into existence a republic
comparable to the Roman republic, an anti-monarchical conception
whose ideals were sympathetic to the progressive thinkers of France,
though France was, at the same time, the seat of Europe’s oldest and
most absolute monarchy. How did this message of freedom from across
the ocean affect the youth of France? Our artist’s ear was sensitively
attuned to the ferment of radical thought. While the painters of the
older school, Boucher and Fragonard, still painted their playful compositions
and tried to dissemble the tragic reality, the dull rumble of the
coming earthquake sounded its note in David’s paintings. His themes
became ever more gruesome and inflammatory. A painting in Marseilles
depicts St. Roche pleading with the Madonna to succor the sick,
and the foreground is filled with dead, plague-stricken bodies. Another
in Valence represents the Death of Ugolino with his Sons—that horrible
scene from Dante’s <i lang="it">Divina Commedia</i> in which the Italian general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
and his five sons die of hunger in a dungeon into which they have been
thrown by his political enemies.</p>

<p>“The Death of Socrates,”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> painted in 1787, now in private possession
in Paris, enhanced David’s rapidly growing celebrity not only in France,
but abroad. No less a personage than Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was then
in Paris, said that he had studied the picture daily for a week, and with
every inspection found it more perfect. It was, he said, “the greatest
achievement since Raffael’s frescoes in the Vatican, and would have done
honor to the Athenians of the Periclean age.” Today, of course, this estimate
seems an exaggeration to us. The composition is assuredly well
planned, and admirable in many of its aspects: the youth, who with
averted face hands the poisoned cup to Socrates, and the other youth in
the background beating his hands against the arch of the doorway. Some
of the gestures seem theatrical, however, and individual figures, such
as the athletic and uninspired Socrates, look as though they had been
derived from a relief. The composition is too studied; it lacks feeling.
Why is it that David’s great historical compositions are apt to leave us
cold, especially those produced during a period of great spiritual and
political turmoil in which his own sympathies were greatly involved?
His part in the revolution amply proves the strength of the passions
which might have found an outlet in his art. Why was he not the realist
to dramatize those struggles like Delacroix who lived fifty years later,
when revolution and world-war were over, yet who painted battles of all
kinds with the most terrific naturalism. The answer lies in this very
fact: Delacroix never witnessed the battle scenes he reproduced; they
are the fruit of his imagination. It is impossible for a significant realistic
art to develop during war and revolution. What one experiences at such
times is so horrible that the imagination is stifled rather than stimulated.
Only insensitive and coarse natures are capable of painting
scenes of horror through which they have lived. When, and as now in
our days, reality weighs all too heavily upon us, art, in self defense, becomes
abstract and withdraws itself from reality. It is for this reason
that the art of the revolution, David’s art, was stylized and cool: the
artist perforce took refuge from the horrors of reality in the kingdom of
his imagination. His art, like the poetry and oratory of the day, was
idealistic in trend. When Robespierre delivered those terrible speeches
that sent so many human beings to the guillotine, he spoke slowly,
rhythmically, in artfully rounded phrases, as though he were holding an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
academic discussion. That the great revolutionaries, among whom we
must number David, thought idealistically rather than realistically, is
proved conclusively by their manner of expressing themselves. Like all
fanatics they lived in a world of dreams and believed their ideas—which
seemed to them so splendid—to be either already realized or on the
verge of realization. They believed only one last great effort to be necessary,
to achieve—though at the cost of human lives—the freedom
of humanity as a whole. This alone can explain why revolutionaries
who pursued their ends through rivers of blood, seem at times inspired
with a noble and unexpected humanitarianism; why they were nearly
all tender and devoted men in their private family life. Danton idolized
his wife and children, the letters of Camille Desmoulins to his bride are
beautiful and touching, and Robespierre, the solitary, the incorruptible,
whose private life was beyond criticism, was a great lover of nature, who
brought, we are told, bunches of wild flowers home with him from his
long walks.</p>

<p>With the portrayal of Brutus (now in the Louvre), who, because of
his profound respect for justice permitted the execution of his sons, we
find ourselves on the threshold of the revolution. Brutus, with stern,
dark countenance, is seated before the Goddess of Justice, while behind
him the bodies of his sons are borne across the scene and the grieving
mother and sisters cling together in the pillared hall of their dwelling.</p>

<p>While today we feel the construction of this picture to be far too
studied, and are inclined to dub it academic, David’s intention was
directed precisely against the then accepted traditional formulas. Whoever
dreamed, said contemporary criticism, of placing the principal
figure in the shadow or planning a composition without regard to the
triangular construction? David left the centre of the canvas purposely
free. Our eyes fall first on a column, a chair, a still life arrangement
on a table, frankly at the expense of the composition’s unity. The incidentals
were drawn with extraordinary care. In order to assure the
accuracy of the classic furnishings, David had the cabinet maker, Jacob,
make the pieces for him after his own designs. The painting created
such an extraordinary sensation that not only did it give the first impetus
to the Parisian vogue for classic furniture, but women’s fashions
were definitely influenced by the loosely coifed hair and long flowing
garments of the feminine figures. Not the least significant part of
David’s contribution to art is the influence he exerted on the decorative
arts and on fashion. It is very rare that the influence of a single artist’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
work on a bygone style can be so clearly measured as in the case of
David, from whose art the decorative art of the Empire period derived.</p>

<p>Only an artist who is much in the public eye can sway styles, and
David became one of the heroes of the day when this composition was exhibited
in the Salon of 1789—the year whose autumn was to see the
outbreak of the revolution. Perhaps no other picture has ever played so
great a rôle in the political and social life of a nation as this work, which
is by no means its author’s finest production, much less among the
finest of art history. All of which goes to prove how unreliable popular
taste is when it comes to a question of contemporary art.</p>

<p>It was of course the subject which evoked such enormous acclaim, for
the very name of Brutus was one to conjure with where the radical
youth of Paris was concerned. Wherever speeches on the new political
conceptions were made there was mention of the name of Rome’s deliverer
from the yoke of Caesar, and from Mirabeau to Danton the people
loved to connect the name of Brutus with their heroes. Even the opponents
of the revolution believed themselves to be inspired by him.
When Charlotte Corday murdered David’s friend Marat, she declared
in prison that she hoped to meet Brutus in Elysium. This veneration
for antiquity, which was characteristic of the revolutionary period, was
greatly fostered by David’s classical compositions.</p>

<p>The narrative of the German writer Halem,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> who visited Paris the first
year of the revolution, and attended some theatrical presentations, tells
us vividly how familiar the populace was with David’s painting. He attended
a performance of the “Brutus” of Voltaire, at the National
Theater, and relates that although he got to the Box Office at five o’clock
in the afternoon, he had the utmost difficulty in obtaining a seat. He
writes, “Mirabeau stood near me at the ticket office and because of his
celebrity was given a place in the fourth balcony. I followed him through
the crowd as best I could and managed to get a chair in a rented loge.
Mirabeau’s entrance was received with thunderous applause and cries
of ‘To the gallery, Mirabeau.’ As he did not respond a deputation
waited on him, the spokesman saying, ‘The French nation demands its
Brutus.’ He had to give in, and was borne away to be received in the
gallery with rapturous applause. What a triumph when later Valerius’
words to Brutus,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="in0">‘On you alone all eyes here are turned,<br>
‘You who broke our chains and gave us the gift of freedom,’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p class="in0">were addressed pointedly to him. At the end of the play I was amazed
to see David’s painting of Brutus reproduced on the stage. In speaking
Brutus’ last words with which the play closes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="in0">‘Rome now is free. That is enough.<br>
The gods be thanked,’</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Vanhove, the leading actor, assumed the pose of David’s Brutus, and the
bodies of his sons were borne across the back of the stage. Every Parisian
knows David’s picture. Everyone instantly recognized the intention of
publicly honoring the artist through this presentation, and general applause
heightened the celebration.” So reads the narrative.</p>

<p>What had happened? Why this enthusiasm of crowd and intellectuals
for a new day? Why these celebrations within celebrations? Even
today, almost one hundred and fifty years later, the words “French Revolution”
rouse our blood, literature is divided into opposing camps by
which either the revolution or the monarchy is condemned, and there
are many who hold in abhorrence the events of those days and the theories
that brought them into being and believe that the awful bath of
blood might have been avoided—as though revolutions were the work
of men and not natural occurrences like tidal waves that the individual
can neither bring into being nor arrest in their course. In the history of
the human race we see again and again how one social stratum after
another climbs up, pushing aside the one that preceded it. When, as in
France, a monarchy and aristocracy has been in power long enough to
weaken in its rule because security and luxury have undermined its morale
and its strength, another stratum, scenting this weakness, seeks to
wrest to itself this power which its fresh and undrained life force fits it
more ably to use. In France this social stratum was the Bourgeoisie, the
Third Estate, which from the beginning of the new era—the sixteenth
century—had grown strong commercially and illustrious in art and
literature, but had not yet achieved any political rights.</p>

<p>The nobility, however, preferred to die rather than allow the power
which they had held for hundreds of years to pass from their hands—quite
naturally, for the function of government is their only element. So
came the unequal battle in which from the beginning the victory was to
the young and powerful stratum. To the ruling class form alone was
left, while the class which aspired to rule possessed passion. Like all
young, unpractised and fanatical fighters, their representatives shot far
beyond their goal, and because, though victors, they were still unpractised
in the use of power, they abused it, destroyed senselessly whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
still lived of the old régime, and then turned upon each other until the
strongest pushed the others aside and became supreme. These strongest
among the strong were successively the leaders of the Constituent
and Legislative Assemblies: first Mirabeau, later the so-called Terrorists,
among them Danton, Robespierre and Marat, and finally Napoleon.</p>

<p>The democratic idea was victorious in the French Revolution despite
Napoleon, who, at first, embodied this idea in himself, and whose Empire
was only the short reaction which follows all new experiments. Its
consequences have persisted to our own day, when as the revolution’s
final result one monarchy after another in the European scene has gone
into eclipse.</p>

<p>If we would be just we must admit that during the revolution there
were heroes on both sides, among the monarchists as well as the revolutionaries.
Among the monarchists—to name a few of the more notable—were
the King, the Queen and Charlotte Corday. On the revolutionary
side we can muster practically all of the leaders, who sooner
or later almost all perished on the scaffold for their principles, and
we can familiarize ourselves with these men through David’s portraits.</p>

<p>The outward events of the beginning of the revolution are well
known. The financial difficulties of the Government compelled the King
and his Advisors to convene the States General, which had not met for
generations. The elections of the deputies had already roused popular
passion, and when the Government, after the Assembly had convened,
endeavored to establish the old order in which all the power was vested
in the upper classes and the Third Estate had none, revolt broke loose.
Under Mirabeau’s leadership the representatives of the Third Estate
left the Assembly, and met, for lack of other quarters, in the Jeu de
Paume (the Tennis Court), where they took oath not to dissolve until
they had established a new constitution. This “Oath of the Tennis
Court” was immortalized by David in a famous composition of which
only sketches by David and paintings after his cartoon by other artists
have been preserved.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>It was a year later, when the Revolutionary Assembly had established
its power, that it recalled that great day of the beginning of the revolution
and commissioned David to paint the picture. It is again the German
poet Halem, who describes the circumstances for us, in a letter
written by him after a visit to the Jacobin Club. He writes: “After continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
speechifying, Dubois de Crancé, a member of the National Assembly,
rose and recalled to the memory of those present that day on
June 20th of the preceding year, when six hundred harried and unarmed
Deputies, surrounded, as he put it, ‘by the Oriental pomp and the bayonets
of despotism,’ laid the cornerstone of French freedom by the well-known
oath of the tennis court at Versailles. Never could he recall
this event, said he, without his heart beating faster, without a glow of
patriotic feeling. He proposed the formulation of an address to the assembly
in which they should be asked to sanction (1.) That the tennis
court, grave of despotism and cradle of freedom, be declared a national
monument, closed, and dedicated to stillness.... (2.) That the wonderful
moment of this first oath be perpetuated by a painting 120′ high and 30′
wide, painted by the greatest of the French masters, and hung in the
National Convention. ‘I say,’ he continued, ‘by the greatest of the masters,
and to whom else could I refer than to him who so nobly depicted
Brutus and the Oath of the Horatii?’ The vaulted hall rang with loud
cries of assent. David the painter was present. Everyone turned toward
him, and pale with enthusiasm the young man stepped to the orator’s
platform and thanked the Assembly in trembling tones for its trust,
which he hoped from his heart to adequately repay, adding touchingly,
‘Sleep will not visit me for many a night.’</p>

<p>“Then ensued a noble rivalry. Abbé Dillon arose first to vindicate his
right to appear in the picture among those taking the oath. He was one
of the few clerics who had belonged to the National Assembly before the
day of the Oath. At that moment he had been obliged to take charge of
the unimportant clerical archives, and consequently had not been present.
He called the members present to witness and his claim was admitted.
Then arose the Comte de Noailles to voice his approval of commemorating
the Oath of those brave citizens. ‘But, alas,’ said he, ‘the
former aristocracy sees itself excluded and how many of us echoed that
oath in our hearts. If only the painter could depict us standing in the
distance with yearning hearts and the burning wish that we might be
among the celebrants of the Oath.’ A third stood up and expressed the
wish that the suppliants might be included in the picture. A fourth demanded
that those wretches who had been present at the Oath, but who
had later fallen for the good cause be not included. A fifth got up and
related a story of Bailly who after fruitless efforts to calm the mob
around the tennis court, stepped out and commanded silence <em>in the
name of the National Assembly</em>. This decision, this command, the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
of the National Assembly then spoken openly to the people for the first
time, had a great effect, had quieted the mob and perhaps determined
its future mood. The orator asked the painter if he could make use of
this incident in his composition. The painter stepped once more to the
platform and thanked them all for their remarks, begging them to remember,
however, that the picture must have both unity and historical
accuracy. He was generally applauded. Mirabeau then took the floor
and with marvellous adroitness conceded full despotic power to genius
such as that of the artist David, and proposed that Dubois de Crancé
prepare a written petition for the National Assembly. Dubois made the
excuse that he was about to leave for the country and cries of ‘Mirabeau!
Mirabeau!’ resounded. Mirabeau understood the call and accepted
the formulation of the address. He read it at one of the next sittings
and the master’s hand was recognized.” So much for the account of the
eyewitness.</p>

<p>David exhibited the cartoon for “The Oath of the Tennis Court” in
the Salon of 1791 and on Barère’s proposal the National Assembly
voted that the painting be carried out at the cost of the State and be hung
in the National Convention as an incentive to zeal. In the Catalogue of
the Exhibition David had stated that it was not his intention to make
likenesses of the members of the National Assembly. How easily,
nevertheless, the Parisian public recognized the various personalities
and what a sensation the composition made is proved by the fact that
Barère practically became a personage through the fact that David portrayed
him writing, in the left foreground, near the principal group—placing
on paper for posterity the tale of the great event. Barère’s not
too inspired journal, <i lang="fr">Point du Jour</i>, became from that moment a much
sought-after sheet.</p>

<p>Despite the many characteristic types, David’s composition “The
Oath of the Tennis Court” is essentially in the monumental style in
which quite justly details are subordinated to the spirit of the whole.
The thronging crowd stands out against the bare walls of the Tennis
Court, in a clearly defined linear pattern, built up by the myriad outstretched
hands. The figures are all filled with a mighty dramatic force.
Bailly, the president, in the centre, stands like a statue of bronze. For
the first time David shook himself free of historical subjects, depicted a
contemporary event and proved himself well able to adapt his idealistic
style to such a theme. In this simplified idiom he attained the expression
of a dignified, rhetorical passion which he was unable to encompass to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
like degree in his historical subjects, and the lofty idealism of the composition
speaks well for the sincerity and intensity of his convictions.</p>

<p>The radical Jacobin Club, whose members had pledged themselves so
enthusiastically to the promotion of his art, became thereafter one of his
favorite haunts. Because, as an artist, he was not particularly judicious
politically he allowed himself to be influenced by the extremists whose
biting logic is often more compelling to temperamental laymen than are
more moderate councils. David had, as his whole career clearly proves,
a rarely fine instinct for the elementary forces in political and social
life, and those to whom he now turned, the representatives of the
“Mountain”—to whom Marat, Danton and Robespierre belonged—were
as a matter of fact the strongest personalities on whom leadership
was soon to devolve. Thanks to them he was elected to the National
Assembly in 1792. He never assumed any leading part, for a defect in
his speech interfered with his public speaking, but he often gave vent to
his enthusiasm only by loud cries of assent.</p>

<p>For the rest his contribution lay in the field of art. He busied himself
with cartoons for monumental paintings, with monuments, with arranging
national festivals, sketching classical costumes for all the functionaries,
and in organizing the artist world, always, we must admit, from
an idealistic standpoint. He has been much criticised for the fact that he
concurred in the King’s execution, and later in Danton’s. In the condemnation
of the King, however, he followed his party; in Danton’s
case his reasons were personal.</p>

<p>The principal oration against the King at his trial in 1793 was made
by Barère, the lawyer, who advocated David’s composition to the National
Assembly, and whom David later immortalized as historiographer
in his work. David painted a masterly portrait of him delivering
the Impeachment of Louis XVI (<a href="#i_fig12">Fig. 12</a>). In the composition which
lies before him on the parapet is written the beginning of the famous
speech which ends with the words, “The Tree of Liberty could not grow
were it not watered with the blood of Kings.” Barère, good-looking and
a clever orator, was not among the nobler of the revolutionaries. He belongs
to that very small group of revolutionary leaders who did not
themselves become sacrifices, but outlived the revolution in all its phases
and held public office even in the times of reaction under Napoleon and
the Bourbons. The Abbe Sieyès was another of this group. He was from
the very first a representative of the Third Estate and achieved some
reputation under Napoleon. David, too, whose art safeguarded him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
among the dangers of the revolution, belongs to them. Both Sieyès,
whose clerical frock was his protection, and David were helped by the
fact that they knew how to stand aloof. Barère, however, was the type
of politician who trims his sails to meet the wind and uses his sagacity
to judge not where right but where might is and then diplomatically
allies himself to it in order to always be in the vanguard of events. His
accusations against the King only expressed the general feeling of the
people whom he strove to please.</p>

<p>True, this general sentiment would not have been possible had not
the monarchy for years been its own worst enemy and made of itself a
laughing stock. There is, indeed, no excuse for political murder. The
King merited the guillotine as little as did thousands of others on both
sides who were sacrificed to it on account of their political opinions.
That Louis XVI was arraigned before a tribunal of his people, however,
was in part at least the fault of the monarchy itself. This particular
King possessed very few of those qualities which a nation expects from
its sovereign. It is one of Fate’s most remarkable ironies that Louis XVI
had every desire to be democratic—but his manner of so being was unfortunate
to a degree. The story runs that as nineteen year old Dauphin
he used to pursue the servants laden with soiled laundry in order to tickle
them under the arms, and as King the blacksmith’s hammer and anvil
were his favorite diversions. The young and charming Marie Antoinette
found it hard to accustom herself to a clumsy husband with soiled hands
who emerged red-faced from his smithy and approached her affectionately.
It happened that did the King espy from a window masons working
in the courtyard below he would run down with rolled-up sleeves to
assist them. There is a certain kind of good nature that is inappropriate
to Princes. His portraits show him as having a clumsy, phlegmatic figure
and plain, not too intelligent features. A typical representative of a
doomed caste, he lacked any energy to stem misfortune, any originality
or appreciation of the new conceptions of the day. It seems as though a
curse rests on people of this type, that everything they do tends only to
make their situation worse, as though they help to bring about their own
destruction. What weakness when in the hour of the greatest danger
Louis writes to his brother, the Comte d’Artois: “I have revoked the
orders that I gave. My troops will abandon Paris, and I will use more
gentle means. Don’t speak to me of a Coup d’État, a display of force. I
feel it is wiser to wait for the storm to abate, and to expect everything
from time, from the awakening of right-thinking people and the love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of the French nation for their King.” Ideas of this kind never arrested
a revolution! It was fortunate for him that his phlegmatic temperament
could find refuge in prayer. This quality helped him to meet
death with resolution but was of small service to the caste he represented.
The times were too violent for Christian temperaments such as
the King’s. Once when David received a commission for a portrayal of
Christ, and his patron remarked subsequently that the figure looked
more like Cato, David’s reply was: “The times are not favorable for
Christendom.”</p>

<p>The King, however, continued to rely on the love of the French for
their monarch. As a matter of fact this sentiment was centuries old and
had persisted until the early years of his reign, but the aristocracy had
helped by derision and calumny to destroy all veneration for the monarchy,
poets and writers sowed doubts as to the efficacy of this form of
government, and the nation began to lose its age-old respect as the
King’s weaknesses became apparent. It is common prejudice that
Princes on account of their eminent position should be different and
more distinguished than the common run of mortals, although history
proves that notable personalities are as rare on the throne as in other
walks of life. If a ruler is gifted, he can allow himself to come into contact
with his people; if, as in most cases, he is not, he is better advised to
allow himself to be admired from afar. Louis XVI, however, did just
the opposite. We know what undignified scenes took place when the mob
on several occasions penetrated the palace. An innkeeper stepped up to
the King and spoke to him saying, after the King’s reply, “You did well
to give me a civil answer, otherwise I’d have made you headwaiter in my
inn tomorrow.” If the King had given this rascal the blow in the face he
deserved, he might have been spared his long martyrdom with the scaffold
at the end. Instead, however, he went up to another ruffian who had
thrust a red cap on his head, and who seemed to be stumbling drunkenly
against a door and helped him to open it. Even on the scaffold he wanted
to help the executioner cut off his hair. The cool fashion in which he
went to meet his doom, at least, merits our admiration. An American
historian has fittingly remarked: “The unruffled dignity with which he
met death was the finest act of his reign.”</p>

<p>Posterity has devoted much sympathy to Marie Antoinette whose
portraits by Vigée LeBrun (<a href="#i_fig25">Fig. 25</a>) and other court painters are familiar
to all art lovers. Although she, too, was by no means an outstanding
ruler her life is particularly rich in human and touching incidents. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
very weaknesses are those which arouse one’s sympathy. Who could
blame the young Princess, brought to Paris from Vienna at the age of
fifteen, that she remained in tutelage to her mother and sought her advice?
But this very relationship which resulted when misfortune overtook
her, in an appeal for help to the foreign courts, brought about her
downfall. Who can fail to understand that the lovely and vivacious Marie
Antoinette, surrounded by the pleasure-loving society of Paris, and tied
to a dull husband to whom, nevertheless, she remained faithful, should
have looked about her for congenial friends. It was this, however, that
gave rise in court circles to those calumnies which so injured her reputation
among her subjects and finally ruined her—calumnies founded
only on gossip, not on facts. Who could blame her for finding burdensome
the exaggerated etiquette of the French court, the public dinner of
the King and Queen once a week, the ridiculous ceremonies of the lever,
the crowd which attended even the birth of her children. And why
should this inexperienced Queen have been held answerable for extravagant
expenditures for gowns and festivities when her predecessors had
spent just as much and the money was always given with the King’s
approval? Her only faults were inexperience and lack of caution. Unfortunately,
when her husband proved himself unfit, she essayed, to her
undoing, to take the political reins in her own hands. In her endeavour
to save herself and her family she allowed her feminine sympathies and
antipathies to influence her politically and so made matters worse. The
price she paid for her mistakes was terrific. In all the history of royalty
there is hardly a more terrible plunge from the pinnacle of power and
wealth to the depths of misery.</p>

<p>Art and culture never bloomed more luxuriantly in France than in
the early years of Marie Antoinette’s reign.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The most exquisite taste
pervaded the mode and was displayed at court functions; the furniture,
ornaments, bronzes and porcelains designed for Marie Antoinette are
among the most delightful productions of French decorative art; the
great French painters of the Rococo period—Boucher, Fragonard and
Hubert Robert—were still alive, as well as the sculptors Houdon, Falconet
and Clodion. It was natural that the young Queen should have
preferred this art to David’s with its cold, stern quality and sombre,
tragic motifs; that she ignored revolutionary literature, preferring to
amuse herself with charming Italian operas or the music of Gluck which
she introduced to France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>That all this splendour collapsed suddenly with the revolution was
not the most serious thing that faced the Queen—misfortune pursued
her into her most intimate family life. She, who loved her children above
all else and who, when the gathering disasters grew closer and closer to
her husband, saw the collapse of one pillar after another of her very existence.
Her youngest child died in his eleventh month. The Dauphin,
a gifted and charming lad of seven, sickened. How could the mother
who lay sobbing across the death-bed of her son at Meudon worry over
the gathering storms in Paris through which pealed the knell announcing
the Dauphin’s death? Then came the days when the mob hung
threateningly around the palace and forced her to leave Versailles
for Paris in its triumphant train. When the populace stormed the
Tuilleries and she feared for the fate of her other children how deeply
offended was the dignity which she possessed in the same measure that
the King lacked it. When the Royal family were brought back from
their unlucky flight to Varennes amid the abuse and insults of the mob,
the King accepted it all with his usual calm and even tried to converse
with his followers. The Queen, on the contrary, suffered so horribly
under the humiliation that her hair turned white over night. This, however,
was but the beginning. Then came the parting with the King who
was led to the scaffold (January 21, 1793); there was the even more
painful parting with her children, and the torture of almost a year in
prison without news of them, within sight of the bloody heads which,
like that of her friend the Princesse de Lamballe, were carried past her
window on pikes. When she was haled before the Tribunal, where she
made answer calmly to all accusations, she was but a shadow of herself.</p>

<p>David made a drawing of her on her way to the scaffold (October 16,
1793)—a horrifying sketch (<a href="#i_fig9">Fig. 9</a>). Does there perhaps speak from it
the injured vanity of an artist whose work had once been ignored by this
former Queen? What a study in contrasts! This was she who only a few
years previously had been the lovely model for the most charming portrait
of the court painters.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette was executed during the “reign of terror,” so-called,
the sanguinary and precarious years 1793–94. Following the results
of the revolution and its excesses all Europe had combined against
France, and only the utmost concentration of internal forces made
victory against such a coalition possible. The National Convention
placed the direction of affairs in the hands of a committee of nine,
among whom were Danton, Robespierre, Marat and St. Just, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Committee saved France. They formed and sent into the field the volunteer
armies which, at first unorganized, gradually obtained ascendancy
over the experienced coalition troops and finally drove them from the
field. Everything that might work injury to the troops at the front was
ruthlessly put aside. Hundreds of aristocrats followed the King and
Queen to the scaffold. Murder was the order of the day and thinned out
not only the friends of the old régime, but also the ranks of the revolutionaries
themselves. The earliest of these to fall in connection with the
King’s execution was Le Pelletier, formerly the Comte de St. Fargeau,
a member of the Convention, who was murdered by a member of the
King’s body-guard on the eve of the execution of the King, on January
20, 1793, because he had voted for the King’s death. Busts of Le Pelletier
and Brutus were placed in the Palace of Justice, and David quickly
completed a fine painting of the victim which he offered to the Convention
in the following terms: “Fellow Citizens, each one of us is responsible
to the Fatherland for those gifts which nature has bestowed on us;
diverse though their expression may be, the goal is the same for us all.
Every true patriot should use every means to inspire his fellow citizens
and bring before them at all times the great examples of heroism and
virtue. I am moved by these thoughts in offering to the National Convention
the painting of Michel Le Pelletier who was murdered in cowardly
fashion because he voted for a tyrant’s death.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately this painting has been lost. Le Pelletier’s descendants,
into whose possession it passed, were Royalists, and hid the painting, destroying
the plates and all the engravings which had been made from it.
The reproduction (<a href="#i_fig15">Fig. 15</a>) was made from the only existing impression
in the Cabinet of Engravings in the Louvre. The composition is conceived
in the grand and austere manner which characterized David’s
work in these days of terror and fanatically exaggerated idealism.</p>

<p>Before six months were up another assassination, this time of one
of the leaders of the revolution—Marat—roused the members of the
Convention and the populace to the utmost. Hardly had the news
spread abroad before one of the members of the Convention arose crying:
“Where art thou, David? You made a portrait of Le Pelletier for
posterity when he died for his country, now the occasion has arisen for
another work.” “This too I will do,” David answered, and produced one
of his most moving compositions (<a href="#i_fig16">Figs. 16</a> and <a href="#i_fig20">20</a>). It is planned with
great power and simplicity, and filled with deep and tragic feeling, for
Marat was his friend. Nothing has aroused more astonishment than this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
friendship of David’s for Marat who has been regarded as the bloodthirsty
instigator of the horrors and deviltries of the revolution. If we
look into the matter more closely, however, we must recognize in Marat
qualities which explain the esteem of men like David. He had remarkable
philosophic and scientific gifts. While his enemies described him as
a quack doctor, or, as Carlisle erroneously states, a veterinary, as a matter
of fact his professional contributions as an oculist were so remarkable
that some of his writings have been reprinted even of late years.
Before the revolution he was the most celebrated oculist of the aristocracy,
and the Comte d’Artois, later Charles X, had appointed him as his
personal physician at a salary of two thousand pounds. His philosophical
writings, such as the three volume <cite>Essays on Man</cite> which appeared in
English and French, achieved a reputation for him abroad. Although he
did not become a member of the French Academy, on account of his disagreement
with Voltaire and his attack on Newton, no less a person than
Goethe expressed himself concerning this injustice. Benjamin Franklin,
too, was among those who visited Marat and were interested in his experiments
in physics.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the revolution he abandoned his career as doctor
and scholar to develop an astonishing public zeal founded on his passion
for the new ideas. He influenced the development of the new forms of
government in no small measure, advised against copying the English
constitution with which he had familiarized himself during a stay in
England, and opposed all who attempted to assume Dictatorship, even
Mirabeau, then Lafayette and later General Dumouriez, whose treason
he foresaw before Dumouriez went over to the Austrians and the Girondists.
He voted for the condemnation of the King, whom he accused
of treason to his country, but advised against his condemnation for
events which happened prior to the revolution. That he was not so
bloodthirsty as his opponents would have us believe is proved by his insistence
that Malesherbes, the king’s advisor, should not be condemned
with him as he was “a wise and venerable old man.”</p>

<p>How many of the wild imprecations which were published against his
enemies, and particularly against the nobility in his journal <cite lang="fr">L’Ami du
Peuple</cite> may be laid at his door, is a question. This paper was suppressed
at various times, and while Marat was in hiding it appeared with distorted
versions of his opinions given out by his enemies or supposed
friends, in the endeavour to bring discredit on him. The really established
facts concerning him place him in no unfavorable light. He opposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the Girondists because he opposed a foreign war, from which he
felt not only the Monarchists but those Radicals who worked in the dark
like the Girondists hoped to draw advantage, and which he felt might
result in the establishment of a military dictatorship. He foresaw the
September murders, and demanded the establishment of a tribunal for
the prisoners. This was not done, and the murders consequently took
place.</p>

<p>True his impassioned pen evoked death and destruction upon his opponents,
but he was persecuted all his life and his enemies retaliated in
kind. More than once he fled from death, hiding for weeks at a time in
cellars and in sewers and contracting from lack of nourishment all sorts
of bodily ills which his iron energy enabled him to disregard. Ill, unable
to attend the Convention, although working all day long, he sought relief
in hot baths where he wrote by placing a board across the bath for his
books and papers. With, in any case, but a short time to live, he fell victim
to the murderer’s knife in the hands of an eccentric and talented
young noblewoman, Charlotte Corday, who hoped to end the revolution
by murdering Marat, whereas her deed had exactly the opposite effect.
She belonged to the Girondist circles whose persecution followed the
outbreak of the war and whose suppression Marat demanded when at
first victory seemed doubtful.</p>

<p>Marat was unquestionably a true friend of the people and his published
and spoken convictions were utterly sincere. In spite of his powerful
and completely independent position, for he was affiliated with no
particular party, he rejected every salaried position, every political distinction
and lived in the poorest circumstances, the very bathtub which
he used and which later attained a sort of celebrity as a curiosity being
borrowed from a neighbor. He received petitioners without number,
and endeavoured in the “Letterbox” of his paper, which he was the first
to introduce, to answer the countless questions put by the people. Charlotte
Corday only obtained an interview with him after several unsuccessful
attempts, by pretending that she was seeking help for a widow
with five children. The paper which Marat holds in his hand in David’s
picture was sent in by her to obtain admission, and not without reason
or effect has the artist made these words legible: “13 July, 1793, Charlotte
Corday to Citizen Marat.” “To be unfortunate is to be sure of your
assistance.” An order for 25 francs which Marat had made out for the
widow in whose name Charlotte Corday sought his aid lies on the stool
in the foreground. Her dagger seems to have found him while he affixed
his signature to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>This composition is among David’s finest achievements in its combination
of very simple forms and great expressiveness. We almost feel the
corpse still lives, still breathes. The most touching naturalness is combined
with a truly heroic style comparable to that of France’s great
tragic poets, such as Racine and Corneille. If we remember that at the
time this picture was painted, the elegant Rococo painters were still
producing their piquant compositions, we recognize that in art as in life
a new era had dawned, an art founded on entirely new conceptions,
which built its compositions with large and massive forms and sought
again those depths of inspiration which had entirely disappeared from
the art of the court painters.</p>

<p>David painted still another composition as propaganda for his political
ideals. A thirteen-year-old drummer boy, Joseph Bara, fell in the
battles in the Vendee in December, 1793, and David was commissioned
by the Convention to immortalize the death of this young hero of the
Republic. This painting, now in the Museum at Avignon, although unfinished,
and very simple in conception, has many charming qualities.
French writers have particularly praised the purity and elegance of the
drawing and the beauty of the youthful form; and in fact the swelling
rhythmic line and vivacity of the bodily forms are very pleasing. If,
however, we analyse the essentially novel quality in this art, it lies in the
reduction of the composition to its bare essentials, combined with a
deepened expressiveness. The scene of the battle in which the boy fell is
only lightly indicated. In the background are clouds which might be
cannon smoke, and far to one side the disappearing form of a standard
bearer. The boy presses the republican cockade to his breast with one
hand—there is no other indication of the day’s realities—everything
else is universal, idealistic. The nakedness, the boy’s idealized features,
the wide empty spaces of the background with its suggestion of a hill—everything
is concentrated on the suffering and inspiration which speak
from the lines of the body. The moment of transition from life to death—which
to be sure the friends of the revolution had ample chance of observing—is
wonderfully depicted. We feel the trembling of the body,
the lift of the breast, the stiffening of the mouth and of the half-closed
eyes. The curious color scheme of the painting, the thin sulphur yellow
background, the pale blue shadows in the figure, the luxuriant dark
brown hair and the brightly colored cockade—contrive a curious effect.</p>

<p>Close bonds of friendship united David to Danton and Robespierre,
the two other leaders of the Reign of Terror, as well as to Marat—although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
this applies only to the early days where Danton is concerned.
The break with him is one of the episodes in the painter’s life which is
most difficult to explain although David can hardly have been alone to
blame, for Danton’s violent nature was prone in moments of passion to
transform friends into foes. It is unfortunate, however, that David did
not exhibit more independence in his political opinions, and that even
though he allowed himself to be dragged in Robespierre’s train, he
helped in the downfall of this most stirring of the revolutionary heroes.</p>

<p>The varying attitudes of revolutionary critics make it even harder to
evaluate Danton’s personality and contribution than that of Marat.
Unlike Marat he was no knight of the pen, but a man of words and
deeds, living fiercely in the passions of the moment, and always at his
best in the times of greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>The personal documents which give us intimate glimpses of the personalities
of the other revolutionary leaders are entirely lacking in
Danton’s case. He was too impulsive for this form of expression, or, in
his leisure moments, too lazy. His portraits give one an impression of
the strength and softness, obstinacy and good nature, energy and procrastination,
which characterized this hero of the revolution whose dramatic
fate has been the inspiration of many a poet. His career was short
but glorious. He rose like a meteor from the obscurity of a provincial
law practice to a dominating position, and during the years 1792 to 1794
his powerful figure was in the foreground and associated with every important
event. His opponents accused him of cruelty and dishonesty.
It is undeniable that he occasionally indulged his wild impulse to destroy
those that opposed him, as witness his speech, “Revolutions cannot
be carried out on tea.” Although the September murders occurred
during his day, his guilt lies rather in not preventing them, than in any
instigation of them. He was occupied at that time with the formation of
the volunteer army, and the monument erected to his memory by the
City of Paris in the eighties, which depicts him inspiring the citizens
with flaming words to departure for the tottering front, was well deserved.
Whatever the faults of his stormy and excitable nature, he did
more than any other to save his country in a moment of grave danger.
So far as his dishonesty is concerned, he seems now and then to have
dealt not all too accurately with State and private property, but his patriotism
was none the less sincere. We must remember that not all active
natures can live on nothing, like Marat and Robespierre, and that a
powerful physical constitution demands other recreations. Danton had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
far more love of life than the dry Robespierre, and liked to be surrounded
by his men and women friends. He finally, to the horror of some historians,
acquired a small country property where he hoped, his labours
over, to retire with wife and children, an ambition destined never to
be fulfilled.</p>

<p>There is in the Museum at Troyes a portrait by David of Danton’s
first wife,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> the brave Gabrielle, a healthy, capable and intelligent
housewife with black eyes and rosy cheeks—a true type of the new
Bourgeoisie. She seems to have been as cheerful as she was kind, and
gave Danton several children to whom he was tenderly attached. She
was destined not to see his downfall. When in February, 1793, he returned
from the Belgian front, he found that his wife had died and been
buried several days previously. It is characteristic both of his love for
her and his untamed nature that seven days after her death he had both
grave and coffin opened up, embraced the corpse and commissioned a
sculptor friend to make a death mask and a bust of her. His friends had
great difficulty in saving him from an emotional breakdown. Even the
cool Robespierre sought to comfort him in the most feeling manner in a
letter in which he pledges him his devotion and friendship unto death.
How quickly and how passionately they lived, these revolutionaries! A
couple of months later Danton married a sixteen-year-old girl, and a
year after that, Robespierre, who had promised—and undoubtedly with
sincere conviction—to be true to him till death, brought him to the
guillotine.</p>

<p>The dual rule of two temperaments so opposed as Danton’s and
Robespierre’s could not endure for long. One cannot conceive a greater
contrast than that between the robust Danton, who loudly proclaimed
his every thought and the elegant frail Robespierre who was all self-control
and deliberation.</p>

<p>How clever and calculating an actor Robespierre was is shown by
the account of his attempted murder by a young girl after the manner
of Marat’s. The attempt failed. The crowd surged up the stairs to his
room to congratulate him. Robespierre was seated in a corner calmly
peeling an orange. Without a word he looked sternly at the intruding
crowd, till in embarrassment they crept away. In his place Danton undoubtedly
would have launched into an impassioned speech of thanks.</p>

<p>Robespierre and his friend St. Just (<a href="#i_fig21">Fig. 21</a>) are both men of pleasing
appearance—almost good-looking as compared to Danton’s ugly bull-dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
countenance. They were, especially Robespierre, who wore a wig
and sword to the last, neat and even elegant in their dress, which differed
sharply from Danton’s almost gypsy-like effect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the “Titan”—so accustomed was he to towering above
his opponents in the Convention and pelting them with his Shakespearian
witticisms—underestimated his puny but quick-witted and accurate
opponent, Robespierre, and before he realized it, he had met his
doom. Just as Danton was about to mitigate the rigours of the Convention’s
procedure, just as he hoped to take things a bit more easily
personally, came his impeachment—plotted so subtly by Robespierre
and his helper St. Just that there was no escape. So desperate a fight
did the giant put up, however, for himself and his friends that it hung
by a thread that his accusers might find themselves ruined in his stead.
After a number of most dubious witnesses had testified against Danton,
St. Just felt it wiser to deny him all defence by having the Court decide
that anyone who conducted himself so offensively toward his judges as
Danton, could be condemned without further hearing. Danton’s mere
presence was enough to dismay the jury, who, moreover, were not really
convinced of his guilt. When they retired, a rumor went about that he
had been acquitted. His accusers, thereupon, rushed to the jury room
and forced the rebellious members to submission. It is here that our
artist, who was a devoted admirer of Robespierre, appears in no favorable
light. He pressed about the jury with other members of the Convention,
and the report runs, called out to those who were still hesitating,
“Do you still believe Danton innocent? Has he not already been
judged by public opinion? Only cowards could so conduct themselves!”
What a fine argument!! One member of the jury burst into sobs, and,
as he could not bring himself to vote for Danton’s impeachment, he was
asked: “Who is more useful to the Republic, Robespierre or Danton?”
“Robespierre,” replied the juryman sobbing. “Then Danton must go to
the guillotine,” was the response.</p>

<p>Then came the day of the execution with its procession of three wagons,
each bearing five or six condemned prisoners, and towering above
them all, Danton looking proudly over the heads of the throng. The
procession passed the little Café de Parnasse where, once upon a time, he
had met his Gabrielle; then the Café de la Regence, and whom did he
see there? It is hard to believe. There sat his former friend, the traitorous
David, busily making a drawing of him (perhaps the drawing in
the museum at Lille, <a href="#i_fig17">Fig. 17</a>). “Lackey!” Danton called to him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
scorn. Next, as the procession passed Robespierre’s house, Danton
called out, “You will soon follow me! Your house will be torn down,
and men will cast salt upon the earth where it stood.”</p>

<p>Danton tried to the last to cheer the friends around him—the ordinarily
merry Camille Desmoulins who was grieving over his bride,
Lucille; the poet Fabre, who affirmed that one of his accusers, who was
also a poet, would doubtless steal his unprinted manuscripts and publish
them under his own name. “Soon that will no longer worry you,” said
Danton to him. The executions were quickly under way. The sun was
setting, and Danton’s giant figure was silhouetted darkly against the
evening sky. One of his friends wanted to embrace him but the executioner
would not permit it. He wanted to finish his task before sundown.
“Idiot,” said Danton to him, “Will you be able to prevent our
heads from kissing each other in the basket?” For one moment he
flinched when he thought of his young wife, “My beloved, shall I never
see you again?” Then, with an effort, he exclaimed, “Come Danton, let
there be no weakness,” and to the executioner, “Show my head to the
people. It is worth it.” These were his last words.</p>

<p>The curse uttered by Danton as he passed Robespierre’s house was
fulfilled all too quickly. Before five months were up, Robespierre trod
the same path, and the wagon was halted before his house to let the
deposed Dictator see the mob in its fury sprinkling his door with the
blood of a slaughtered ox.</p>

<p>And now the earth began to tremble under David’s feet. He was to
the last a devoted adherent of Robespierre. When the latter on the eve
of his fall read to the Jacobins his defence which ended with the words,
“I am ready to drink the poisoned cup,” David cried out “We will drink
it with you.” He must have been thinking of his portrayal of the death
of Socrates, but he probably hardly realized how imminent was the fall
of the last great leader of the revolution and how very nearly he himself
was involved in that fall.</p>

<p>David, as we know, did not complete his painting of Bara. This was
because he was planning for the Convention a festival in honor of the
fallen drummer boy. He was a great master in the arrangement of such
celebrations. With their carefully designed costumes, massed choirs, improvised
statues and profusion of flowers and patriotic orations, they
must have been astonishingly impressive, comparable only to the national
festivals of the Roman Empire. Unfortunately these artistic
manifestations of the revolution, which constituted an appreciable part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
of David’s life work, were in their nature transitory. David had set the
date of the Bara festival for the 10th Thermidor (July 26, 1794). This
was the very day of Robespierre’s downfall, and his execution took place
two days later. Through this coincidence of date—or had David been
warned?—he did not attend the sitting of the Convention on the 10th
Thermidor. Had he done so, he would undoubtedly have been arrested
and guillotined with Robespierre’s other adherents.</p>

<p>When he came into the Convention hall three days later he was denounced
by André Dumont and obliged to defend himself. He probably
believed the end had come. He was no orator, and his defect of speech
made things still harder for him. He stood there, pale and fearful, and
it is said a nervous perspiration so dewed his forehead that it dripped
down his coat to the floor. Where now was the courage with which he
had offered to die with Robespierre; with which when Marat was attacked
in the Convention he had once exclaimed: “Kill me in his place!”
Yes, it was undoubtedly easier to make drawings of one’s enemies and
former friends on their road to the guillotine than to defend one’s life
before a tribunal of the people. He made so pitiful an impression that
they let him go. Two days later, however, it was thought wiser to arrest
him. At first his sentence was light and he was allowed to work, but
soon, after another stormy session of the Convention, he was transferred
to the Luxembourg. His imprisonment lasted five months. Toward
the end, conditions were again made easier and he was allowed
to work. Then he was set free, and again, this time at the instigation of
his fellow artists, imprisoned for months. Finally during the general
amnesty at the end of the year 1795 he again obtained his freedom. This
was the end of his political activities. The terrible months of uncertainty
during his imprisonment, when death so often stared him in the face,
must have been a time of spiritual growth for him, for they resulted in
his painting a marvellous series of portraits. His achievement at this
time, and during the following years when the revolution slowly ebbed,
is the greatest of his artistic career.</p>

<p>There is first of all a portrait depicting the artist at the period of his
imprisonment (<a href="#i_fig22">Fig. 22</a>). It is seldom that a self portrait expresses so
vividly the perplexities of a period of terror as do the haunted eyes of
this young fanatic. These eyes have been called evil, and David himself
described as a good artist but an evil man. The moral equipment of the
revolutionaries cannot be summarized in such simple fashion, however.
David’s political opponents hit nearer the mark when they called him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the defence of Marat, “What does that prove so far as Marat is concerned?
Only the devotion of an honorable man who is allowing himself
to be carried away by excitement.” That David’s political life was so
passionate, may be due in part to the youthful violence of his friends.
Nearly all the revolutionary leaders were in their early thirties, an age
which is apt to be the stormy period of a man’s life. Old people do not
bring about revolutions. David, to be sure, was forty at the time of its
outbreak, but see how youthful he still looked; and the unspent store of
his strength is proved by the great age to which he lived.</p>

<p>He painted another important work during his imprisonment—a
little landscape of the Luxembourg Gardens as seen from his window
(now in the Louvre), one of the first modern realistic landscapes which
seem to foreshadow Courbet’s efforts. The eighteenth-century conception
of landscape was very different. The landscapes were like theatrical
scenery, built up with carefully divided “wings.” Here, for the first
time, a French artist dared to paint an unpromising bit of earth exactly
as he saw it, with all nature’s accidental qualities. A garden fence in the
middle runs diagonally across the picture, while over in one corner is an
avenue of trees which should conventionally have been in the center of
the canvas—no planned symmetrical construction, no coulisses in
the foreground. Here, too, was a break with tradition—a new beginning.</p>

<p>The two portraits of Monsieur and Madame Seriziat (<a href="#i_fig18">Figs. 18</a> and
<a href="#i_fig19">19</a>), painted by David while he was still under arrest, are particularly
illuminating as regards his personality. How could an artist, above
whose head the sword of Damocles still hung, paint such sunny and
optimistic portraits? We would, in fact, appreciate only one side of
David if we think of him always as the stern Roman, never as the light-hearted
Frenchman. From the beginning to the end of his artistic career,
side by side with his classic compositions and his moving revolutionary
portrayals (<a href="#i_fig23">Fig. 23</a>), he painted a series of charming portraits
which prove that through all the horrors of the revolution he never lost
his Gallic light-heartedness or his feeling for grace. At the beginning of
the series stands the pleasing portrait of Vigée LeBrun, painted in 1793,
and at the end, the famous portrait of Madame Recamier painted in
1800. In these works there is still an echo of eighteenth century elegance,
a trace of that esprit and glamour which always distinguishes
the best of French art. Yet the forms, the simple outlines, the wide
empty spaces of the background and the flatness of the treatment is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
wholly new. And besides in these portraits we find for the first time
representations of the Bourgeoisie which replace those of the aristocracy
of the eighteenth century and whose best types became henceforth
the patrons of art which in former days the courts had been.</p>

<p>Scarcely a year had passed since David’s escape from prison when his
freedom was again endangered by the royalist youth who believed that
the moment of reaction had arrived. But now there appeared in his studio
one day—this was at the end of 1796—an officer sent by General
Bonaparte who asked in his name whether he would accept an offer of
safety with his army in Italy. It is evidence of the extraordinary farsightedness
of Napoleon that his feelers extended everywhere—wherever
there might be future support for his power. But David did not accept
the offer: not that he had not at once recognized in Bonaparte his
coming greatness—in fact he already called him his “hero”—for
David’s instinct was in this respect just as unerring as was Bonaparte’s—but
that he had most likely promised himself, as a result of the terrible
experience of the last years, to no longer become embroiled in political
affairs. Napoleon’s political position was at this time not yet assured,
he did not give up the idea of tempting our artist. When he returned
from Italy he called at his studio for the first time and wished to
be painted. His restless spirit, however, could endure only one sitting.
The wonderful sketch which resulted (<a href="#i_fig24">Fig. 24</a>) is still in existence and
proves that Bonaparte knew what he was about when he desired David
to become the blazoner of his coming power. No artist has given us from
the very beginning so idealized a conception of his personality. The
breadth of the design in this unfinished composition; the noble verve of
the position; the dauntlessness of expression: everything was in keeping
with the great historical style that Napoleon himself might have
dreamed of. A few weeks later David received an invitation from Napoleon
to accompany him on his Egyptian campaign. Again the artist refused
although he had already entirely succumbed to the personality of
the great general. When Napoleon returned from Egypt he visited David
frequently and flattered him by taking him around Paris and talking
over with him his plans for beautifying the city. At the end David fell
completely under the influence of the stronger personality, as had happened
before in the case of Marat and Robespierre. And in the same degree
that Napoleon’s personality was more powerful than that of the
revolutionaries, his influence was the more crushing. Only in this way
can we account for the fact that the one-time revolutionary-champion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of democratic ideals became at the end the court painter of the emperor.
But this was not to the advantage of David’s art. So long as
Napoleon had not yet reached the height of his power—that is until
about 1800—our artist succeeded in producing several imposing compositions
in honor of the First Consul, especially the famous portrait on
horseback, where he is shown ascending the Alps, symbolically representing
his rise to the highest heights of glory—certainly an extraordinary
translation of a still living and even young personage into the
realm of the ideal and of history. But when Napoleon had become emperor
and David his none too carefully treated servant, his art became
weaker and weaker from year to year, the while his compositions grew
larger in size. When after the downfall of the emperor and the return of
the Bourbons he left France in exile and settled in Brussels, where he
lived until the year 1824, he still attracted the attention of the world
through his many pupils and admirers, though his art now belonged to
the past.</p>

<p>David belongs with the few artists who are mentioned not only in the
history of art but also in political history—perhaps a doubtful advantage,
for preoccupation with two so conflicting fields as art and politics,
was only possible through the sacrifice of one or the other. Indeed David
as politician lived only in the shadow of the greater ones. In the field of
art he was at his best when his political ideas did not tempt him too
much toward abstract themes—that is to say, in portraiture, when he
had the model before him. As a human being his forte lay in a highly
sensitive response to the most intense intellectual and emotional currents
of his time. Since, during the greater part of his lifetime, these
currents were not primarily of an artistic nature, his art could not always
take advantage of them.</p>

<p>This too intense interest in the great events of the day was perhaps
his weak point: the fact that he submitted too easily to the ephemeral
demands of his contemporaries, preferring the fortune of a successful
present to the glory which the future reserves only for the highest aims
and the complete renunciation of the demands of the day. From his
earliest years David had the critics on his side, and the steady stream of
admirers that had gathered about him showed no decrease, remaining
with him even in the most dangerous periods of his life. How different
did it fare with one of his really great contemporaries—Beethoven—who
throughout his life had to contend with uncomprehending critics,
but who is quoted as having said in this connection, “Damn me as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
as you like; you are not able to damn me into eternity.” Just as to the
great ones is given as a recompense for the misunderstanding of their
day the consciousness of their own value to the future, so the artist who
is glorified in his own time knows his own limitations. David said himself
that many of his own works such as the Brutus no longer had a living
value. It was his bad fortune that he was in too close contact with
the affairs of the revolution, for the greatest art (we return here to our
introductory remarks) cannot arise in the midst of bloodshed. There can
be no doubt of where the unattached and eternal art lay during David’s
period, when we call to mind the poetry of Goethe or the music of
Beethoven. The centers where the greatest poet and the greatest musician
of the days of the revolution lived—Weimar and Vienna—were
far removed from the theater of the struggle, just as Rembrandt’s art
flowered outside the scene of the Thirty Years War. From a distance
the deafening war clangor permeated into the quiet worlds of these rulers
in the realm of art; from a distance through transfiguring light appeared
to them the new ideas for which the struggle was waged. Such
should be the milieu where the greatest art is born—impregnated with
the shower of the newly created ideas, but quietly and not to such a degree
that its own existence is imperilled.</p>

<p>This chance for perspective also makes it possible for the really great
artist to judge worldly matters more clearly than the one who lives in
the midst of the fray. How much more impartially, for instance, did
Beethoven, who otherwise did not care for politics, judge the events of
the times than David, who worried about them half his lifetime! Beethoven,
also, like the best of his contemporaries, was democratically inclined
and applauded the new revolutionary ideas. When Napoleon became
First Consul he recognized his greatness and desired to celebrate
in his music the hero who had brought the revolution to completion.
He began his great symphony, the “Eroica,” and wrote upon the title
page the name of Bonaparte next to his own. When the news was
brought to him that Napoleon had crowned himself emperor, indignant
that his illusions had been dispelled and that Bonaparte had become as
tyrannical as the crowned heads which the revolution had deposed, he
tore up the dedication and began the symphony anew, ending it with the
funeral march.</p>

<p>The fascination of the art and the personality of David lies in the fact
that they reflect the period of the greatest intellectual and social upheaval
of his nation—an upheaval such as comes to every nation once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
in its history, with such a force that through it the whole world is shaken.
In such moments of history creations of centuries collapse at one blow.
The foundations of faith and of morals waver; the ties of family and
friendship are torn apart and even the customary tasks of the day, under
other circumstances serving as an anchor alike to the weak and the
strong, appear useless and cease: like the flood of the terrific storm
which engulfs us, rudely tearing away from the strongest the guiding of
their own fate, and forcing the slothful into the maelstrom of the higher
general will. What remains for the individual who, hesitating, stands at
the edge of the precipice, viewing the tragic drama? Can he do better
than to plunge into the stream, keeping afloat as best he may?</p>

<p>Happy the one who in such periods succeeds like our artist in preserving
so much of his own identity that from out the history of this
chaos his name still rings with vibrant life.</p>

They prove clearly the endeavour of David to replace by his own the eighteenth-century style of
drawing as he had learned it in the Boucher school. Instead of modelling the figures through diagonal
parallel lines, indicating the shadows and neglecting the outlines, he tries to produce the effect of plasticity
through clearly connected outlines alone, leaving out the modelling entirely. In this respect also
David is the predecessor of artists of the most modern school. He developed his style of drawing in
connection with his studies after Roman sculptures and was strongly influenced in his method of designing
by a young French sculptor, Lamarie, whom he met in Rome. (See Charles Saunier: <cite>Louis
